### Hey there, I'm Shivam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for exploring and creating with technology. 

This GitHub has some of my projects and experiments where I explore our interactions to hardware and software. I like to work on creative solutions for the projects I tackle, including web and mobile apps, chatbots, and embedded hardware projects.

Check out my website where I write some posts and showcase my projects if you're interested in learning more about my work.

Feel free to look at my repos and reach out if you have any questions or ideas to share.
